Description: Random Access File Reader
        -------------------------
        
        | This is a small library that allows for reading any given line in a file without having to read all the lines before it
          or load the entire file into memory.  Only the line indexes and lengths are held in memory, which enables random
          access even on very large files at a very minuscule memory cost.
        
        Installation
        ============
        ``pip install random-access-file-reader``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        | Usage is very straightforward, and standard csv line endings (newline character), value delimiter (comma), and
          quotation character (double quote) are the defaults.  These can be changed in the constructor.
        |
        | The ``get_line()`` and ``get_line_dicts()`` methods return a list of rows.
        | Plain text file example:
        
        ::
        
            from randomAccessReader import RandomAccessReader
        
            reader = RandomAccessReader('~/myfile.txt')
        
            # single line
            line = reader.get_lines(2)[0]
            print line
        
            # multiple lines
            lines = reader.get_lines(3, 3)
            for l in lines:
                print l
        
        
        | Csv example:
        
        ::
        
            from randomAccessReader import CsvRandomAccessReader
            reader = CsvRandomAccessReader('~/myfile.csv')
        
            # single line
            line = reader.get_line_dicts(5)[0]
            for x in line:
                print x + " = " line[x]
        
            # multiple lines
            lines = reader.get_line_dicts(6, 6)
            for l in lines:
                for x in l:
                    print x + " = " l[x]
